<!-- Wireframing with a pair was kind of difficult simply because we had to find a wireframing site to use, the rest of it was easy. Making the HTML page as a pair made things go much faster than they normally would, since we both had a pretty good handle on HTML and could fill in the blanks for each other when we got stuck.
Wireframing definitely helped us when we were writing the HTML because it gave us a solid reference point to tell us what semantic elements to use.
My pair and I decided that a good wireframe gives you a nice starting point for writing your code, as well as a good rough sketch of what your site should look like in the end.
Every semantic element we used in the code was new to both of us as we had never really used any before.
