      <h2>Diversity in Tech</h2>

      <h2>2/14/16</h2>

      <p>I'm sure it's no surprise that in today's world, technology-based jobs are on the rise. The majority of Americans carry smart devices-tablets, phones, computers, and the like. So it only makes sense that there is a demand for people who can design things like applications and sites that are incorporated in all of this technology, right? Here's another thing to consider-if so many Americans from so many different cultural and ethnic backgrounds are using technology, shouldn't companies producing these devices and applications have a diverse group of employees designing and managing their products? The clear answer to both of those questions is yes; but if we look at diversity statistics for many big companies that reach a diverse group of consumers (Apple, Twitter, Dropbox), why do we see that their employees are overwhelmingly white and male?</p>

      <p>The biggest part of technology's diversity problem comes from the companies themselves. In 2016 there are more and more women and ethnic minorities with technology-based skill sets, but companies just won't hire them. Some companies have recently come under fire for their abysmally low hire rates for non-white and non-male employees, and have taken actions like hiring a handful of people from those demographics into leadership roles, but their overall diversity numbers basically stay the same. Sometimes a company will even respond to claims of poor diversity by hiring more people from over-represented groups and claim that they will change in the future (looking at you, Twitter). Companies like these act as if a lack of diversity is just a harmless trait of the company instead of a serious problem. How can your company meet the needs of its users if its staff doesn't represent them?</p>

      <p>Another serious issue in tech is education. Many studies show that minority students lack access to the same educational resources as their Caucasian counterparts. This allows companies to say, "Well, we'd like to hire them but they just don't meet the qualifications." It would be unrealistic to say that education is a level playing field; the resources a school has available to it are, in many cases, based on the income of that school's neighborhood. Children from high income neighborhoods and families enjoy the luxuries of prestigious local and private schools, additional resources (tablets, newer computers, cleaner environments, better teaches, etc.) and are given an unfair boost over children from families who live in low income or inner city neighborhoods. You can't expect a child to learn how to use and develop technology that they have no access to.</p>

      <p>There are many ways that these problems to be fixed, but they all have their own risks of failure and backlash. We could require that all companies meet a staff diversity requirement, where a certain percentage of their staff has to represent different gender and ethnic groups; the problem with that solution is that people could make claims that candidates were only hired for a position because of their race or gender instead of their qualifications (even when there's proof showing that's not the case). That method would risk creating even more hostile work environments for people of underrepresented backgrounds.  A better solution would be to tackle the beginning of the problem: educational and environmental obstacles.</p>

      <p>Companies could receive tax breaks and benefits by providing resources, internships, and jobs for children and young adults from low-income schools or schools with a high percentage of underrepresented groups in technology. Another way to achieve this solution would be to revise the way educational funding is allocated: There could be an income-based statewide educational tax that is distributed to provide equal resources for all schools in that state. The downside to the first solution is that you could argue that companies would be getting paid or coerced to do something charitable, which defeats the purpose of charity. Companies could bring people from minority gender and racial groups into internships with no intentions of hiring them, or hire them into roles that have little control over how the company operates just so that their company "looks" diverse enough to get that extra tax break. The problem with the "educational tax" solution is that we would have to figure out a way to change our tax system to implement it(which would take...who knows how long), and high income families might respond by moving to wealthier states to continue to fund and access better schools with better resources (known as "white flight" in most cases).</p>

      <p>The biggest problem with this entire issue is getting people to care. Companies that are predominately white males don't care about the fact that people that aren't like them aren't receiving the same opportunities they are. Families that bring in more income aren't concerned with the families and children that don't. A vast majority of the people that have the most control over making these changes don't understand what the problem is because they don't have to worry about it; even if they do understand the problem, they don't even want to take partial responsibility for fixing it. We have to find a way to show them the benefits of diversity in a way that they can't ignore. The real question isn't how we'll increase diversity; it's how we'll get everyone to want diversity.</p>
